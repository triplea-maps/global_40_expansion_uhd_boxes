<br>
This mod will play more like a TableTop game than most triplea maps. While there is the need for edit use, it is completely playable and will become second nature after a few games. It's <b>Huge</b> upside is well worth the effort.<br>

The following is just going to address the triplea game play, although the Help button top right has some Unit information. You will need to read the rules download for full game information.<br>
<br>
<b>Here are some Important Ones</b> Pointed out by Victory First.<br><br>
It’s important to know these Player-Enforced rules. Everything is stated in the game notes, so you can give that one a read as well, but just highlighting here the most important ones:
<br><br>
Transports need to be selected last as casualty.
<br><br>
Use Edit when conducting a combat that includes Paratroopers or U-boat units. <br><br> <b>Wolfpacks and Paratroopers have been updated and Edit is now rarely needed.</b><br><br>
When Edit mode is on, you can select any number of casualties you want, regardless of the rolls you made. Count up the hits manually, keeping in mind the improved attack/defense value of the units.<br>
<br>
If fighting a Large Naval battle, it is suggested to use Edit and select the casualties manually. It actually works quite well, as you usually have to adjust the triplea chosen casualties anyway.
<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
Once Edit is on, you will need to click back to Actions in order to fight the battle.<br>
<br>
Another option is to use Axisandallies.org dicebot. That tends to be slower but is less punishing when you make a mistake. For Landmines, you must use dice bot <br>
<br>
You have two placement phases - one for units like Waffen units, US Marines, etc that are active immediately- and one for your normal units. Don’t place normal stuff like Tanks or Infantry in the first placement phase.<br>
<br>
Use edit to move Paratroopers over Enemy Territory and for LCVs.<br>
<br>
When an Army is active, you should edit a new army-leading unit depending on the units it commands. Barnee should let you know more about this since I don’t know exactly what army-leading unit commands what.
<br><br>
When doing Landmine Battles with Dicebot, Follow these steps:<br><br>
Do your Entire Combat Move.<br>
Roll for any Landmines that have been crossed and make note of any hits.<br>
At the Beginning of Combat, if there were any LM hits, go to Edit and remove the appropriate units and LMs.<br>
Then, turn Edit off and fight the battle normally.<br><br>
If there is only one battle to be fought, you will need to be in Edit before you start Battle Phase, as triplea will immediately start the battle.<br>
<br>
If you start the Battle in Edit, you will have to Fight All of it in Edit.
<br>
<br>
Widen Battle Window to Show Number of Units if Needed.<br>
<br>
<b>Timetable</b>
<br>
<br>
Shows when new Units are available. The "Red" year token, denotes what the current year is. If you <b>Hover</b> over "Free Ships" it will tell you what those Ships are.<br>
<br>
<b> Armies and Corps </b><br>
<br>
Here is a more detailed look at which ones to use.<br>
<br>
The most common Army is "Waffen_Oberst_3" <img src="Waffen_Oberst_3.png"/>
He will Boost Himself and one of the Following:<br>
"Waffen_Para" <img src="Waffen_Para.png"/> 
<br>
"Waffen_Arty" <img src="Waffen_Arty.png"/> 
<br>
"WaffenPnzrGrndr" <img src="WaffenPnzrGrndr.png"/> 
<br>
Next most common is "Waffen_Oberst_4" <img src="Waffen_Oberst_4.png"/>
He will Boost Himself and a "waffen_panzer" <img src="waffen_panzer.png"/> <br>
"Waffen_Oberst_2" <img src="Waffen_Oberst_2.png"/> will Boost Himself and a "waffen_infantry" <img src="waffen_infantry.png"/><br>
Regular Oberst doesn't Boost anything. Including Himself. <img src="Waffen_Oberst.png"/>
<br>
The most common Commisar is "Soviet_Commisar_3" <img src="Soviet_Commisar_3.png"/> will Boost Himself and a Tank. <img src="armour.png"/>  
<br>
"Soviet_Commisar_2" <img src="Soviet_Commisar_2.png"/> will Boost Himself and a Artillery. <img src="artillery.png"/>
<br>
"Soviet_Commisar_1" <img src="Soviet_Commisar_1.png"/> will Boost Himself and a Infantry. <img src="infantry.png"/> or a Paratrooper <img src="russian_para.png"/> 
<br>
"Soviet_Commisar_A2D3" <img src="Soviet_Commisar_A2D3.png"/> will Boost Himself and a Guard Infantry. <img src="guard_infantry.png"/> The 3 Blue Dots Denote Defend at 3 and the 2 Red ones Attack at 2.
<br>
Regular Commisar doesn't Boost anything. Including Himself. <img src="Soviet_Commisar.png"/><br>
<br>
<b>Desert Armies</b> Follow the same structure. Explained in detail in "Desert Army". <br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
"Tank_Generals" may <b>Not</b> be part of a Corps. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit Use</b><br>
<br>
Most Starting Units will be on the Left side of the Edit Window. Unfortunately, the Window is <b>Inconsistent</b>, so they won't always be in the same place.<br>
<br>
<b>Boxes</b><br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
<br>
There is an Invisible Factory that allows placement in Boxes. Use <b>Caution</b> when editing units in and out of Boxes so you don't delete it. If you do by accident, you can edit it back in. It's called "BoxFctry". <br>
<br>
<b>You Must Use Edit</b> to Move To and From and will only be able to move in CM and NCM. Use "Perform Move Or Other Actions" while in Edit. You will be able to move other Players' Units as well. However, you can only move to legal territories. For example, Germany can't move Units into russia without being at War.<br><br> <b> NOTE<br> You may temporarily edit russia and Germany to War if you have a large number of moves to make and then edit back to Neutrality.</b> <br>
<br> You will need to Edit otherwise and Manually Place/Replace.<br><br>
Also, you can move units in Edit, then move additional units somewhere else and not have to hit "Perform Move ..." again. You can do multiple moves. In other words, you don't need to click on "Perform Move or Other Actions" for every move.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
<br>
If needing to use Edit after Combat Move and before Combat and there will be only 1 battle, you will need to edit <b>Before</b> your Combat Move, as after, you will go straight to the battle without being able to edit. If multiple battles are taking place, you will be able to edit before the first battle is fought to <b>remove</b> units but not place. Actually, you can place but they will have no effect on the battle. <br>
<br>
If using Edit to move units in Combat Move, it may take you over an unintended route which will conquer Empty Enemy Territories. Use Edit to adjust after combat or stop at a Territory before it takes you over the unintended route and then continue to your destination. Sometimes that will prevent an unintended route.<br>
<br>
Also, you can Edit Units to a Territory and then Move them the same turn but you <b>Cannot</b> Move Units and then Edit them into the Territory you moved from.<br>
<br>
<b>Landmine Boxes</b> are for Informational purposes only. You cannot move units there. The top Territory is where the LM is located. The color denotes which LM. The bottom Territory is the Border it defends against.<br>
For Example. Western Germany has a Orange LM with France at the bottom. That means that Orange LMs in W GER defend against the border with France.<br>
When in doubt, use the Comment Log located under "View" upper left, to designate which LMs are defending which border. <br> <br>
Landmines have to be hand rolled with either the Dice Roller or Dice Bot from A&A.org.https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/39917/when-you-need-a-topic-to-use-the-dicebot-do-it-here/27<br>
<br>
Usually, after editing LMs, the next time you open edit, those LMs will have moved to the left column.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
Some high use areas have border specific LMs. When you hover on them, they will tell you which border they are defending. These Territories are for Germany<br>
112 Sea Zone<br>
Denmark<br>
Holland<br>
Norway<br>
Normandy<br>
West Germany<br>
<br>
For Russia<br>
Western Ukraine<br>
Belarus<br>
Ukraine<br>
Bryansk<br>
Rostov<br>
Caucasus<br>
Novgorod<br>
Archangel<br>
<br>
<b>Active Army Groups</b> must be rolled with Edit as above for complete Rule Compliance or Players can agree to count the hit when the Army Group is no longer Active the way triplea does it. Edit an "Inactive Army Group to the Defending Player if it doesn't have one to offset the Attacking one. Do Not take as casualty until after the Attacking one has been killed.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> It may be Helpfull to write down the Units that are in the AG so you will know when the AG is no longer intact during Battle. That way you can kill the "Active Flag" at the proper time.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
The Army Group Does Not provide a Movement Bonus to the Units in the AG. They must still move at their allotted amount.<br>
<br>
<b>Overflow Boxes</b><br>
use edit to place the Overflow Token into the desired Territorry. Then move the Overflow Units to the correct Box. There are two for Land and one for Sea Zones.<br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
You need to edit to <b>"Hvy_BB_Dmgd" and "BB_Damaged"</b> before your next combat turn if needed and apply the appropriate amount of damage. This is so it can continue to attack in battle but not after battle when taking damage. Most BBs will repair, so will rarely be necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>Pacific Island Bonuses</b><br>
<br>
These should now work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes triplea will not allow you to make a legal landing on a Carrier. Use edit to replace Units as needed.
<br>
<br>
Use Edit to correct.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br><br>
Battleship Bombard does not work with LCVs. You can Hand roll the Battle or use Edit to temporarily add a Transport(s) then Edit the correct Unit total at end of Combat.<br><br>
<b><NOTE</b>
When replacing Units with Edit, most starting Units will be on the Left side of the Window.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You may be able to Edit Territory Control and then change Units, then change back without undoing your moves. This may cause movement problems, especially for Air, so be aware.<br><br>
When Attacking with LCV and Air Units, it will not allow Air Units to retreat. Do the Battle in Edit or use the Dice roller. If you forget, use Edit to adjust to the correct outcome.<br>
<br>
<b>Section I</b><br>
<br>
<b>United Kingdom One Economy</b><br>
<br>
UK may only spend 20 PUs in the Pacific Theatre. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>China Bonus Infantry</b><br>
<br>
China has it's Game Start income boosted by 3 PUs to represent the added Infantry. It also has a 3 PU National Objective. It will not show up in the Objectives tab but does show at end turn.<br>
<br>
<b>Weapons Developement</b><br>
<br>
<img src="DevelopWeapons.png"/> <br><br>
You may activate tech in Early 1943, Round 7, in "Map Options". You will need to save the game and turn on before restarting game. You need to turn on at the End of Round 6 before Round 7 starts or it won't activate until Round 8.<br>
<br>
<b>Double Place Phase</b><br>
<br>
Waffen Infantry, Waffen Panzer, Commandos, Marines, Unarmed Mines, Waffen Paratroopers, Waffen Artillery, Waffen Heavy Tank, Wolfpacks, Heavy Industry and Underground Factories are all placed in the First Placement Phase. Everything else as normal.<br>
If placing both a Minor Factory and a Underground Minor, Place the Minor in the first phase and the Underground in the second.<br>
<br><b>NOTE</b><br>
Only Place Units that are activated that turn in the First Place Phase.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Soviet Guard Infantry</b><br>
<br>
<img src="guard_infantry.png"/> <br><br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Waffen Infantry</b><br>
<br>
<img src="waffen_infantry.png"/> <br><br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Otherwise they work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Waffen Panzer</b><br>
<br>
<img src="waffen_panzer.png"/> <br><br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>4 and 5. British Commandos and USA Marines</b><br>
<br>
<img src="commando.png"/> <img src="marine.png"/> <br><br>
Commando/Marine units now attack at 2 and get +1 when paired with Artillery. If attacking by themselves, you need to edit in a CommandoA1/MarineA1 unit or they will attack at 2 instead of 1. They will defend correctly.<br>
<br>
You will also need to edit when placing in a Allied Factory. Purchase a "1_PU" and then replace an Infantry with a Marine/Commando in the Allied Factory.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Elite Infantry</b><br>
<br>
<img src="elite.png"/> <br><br>
You may only have 1 Elite in any Territory at any one time. This includes Allied Elites. This is Player Enforced. If you are forced to retreat to a Territory that has another Elite or Allied Elite, kill them with edit before Non Combat Move.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
When being supported by Artillery and other Artillery supportable units are present, the Artillery sometimes will support only 1 of the Elite's rolls as well as 1 other unit. So, the Elite will show up in the "1" category in the "Battle Window", but the rolls will be correct.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Paratroopers</b><br>
<img src="USA_para.png"/> <br><br>
<b>Paratroopers have been updated and Edit is now rarely needed</b><br><br>
...paraBoost Units have been added to the Major Powers. They provide +2 on Attack and +1 on Defense for the first round of battle. They will auto die after combat rolls and can't be taken as a hit.<br>
If planning a All Paratrooper Attack, move the ParaBoost into battle with the Paratroopers.<br>
<br>
Paratroopers Move 2 and +1 from an Airfield. Player Enforce correct land movement of 1 move only. Paratroopers may require edit for their "Air Movement". Before attacking, if facing AA fire, activate "Roll Dice" under "Game", top left, or use Dicebot and roll for AA fire. Then use edit to kill any hits and if needed, select "Perform Move Or Other Actions" and then click on the Paratrooper and make a legal move. If there is only 1 battle to be fought that Combat Phase, you will need to do this at the <b>START</b> of your Combat Move.<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
 If accompanied by Air Units during an edit assisted attack across water, along with other ground Units performing an <b>Amphibious Attack</b> , All Paras <b>MUST</b> die before retreating the Air Units or the game will freeze.<br>
If no accompanying ground Units, you can't retreat the Air Units until <b>ALL</b> Paras are dead. It will then throw a "Withdraw" error when you retreat the remaining Planes, but that is one you can ignore.<br>
<br>
They will also be allowed to retreat from Land Battles. This is a legal move.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
When Attacking AA Guns, you will need to <b>Hand Roll</b> before Battle and Edit for a precise result, otherwise Paratroopers will be ignored by AA Fire.<br>
<br>
<b>Also</b> if you are only doing 1 attack that phase, don't forget to turn off edit before ending your Combat Move. Otherwise, it will go straight to Battle and you can't turn edit off then.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If moving with edit, it may take an unintended route and conquer empty Enemy Territories in the process. You may move with your intended course and stop when triplea deviates from your intended path, or edit unintended Territories to correct ownership.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Lend-Lease</b><br>
<br>
After the Allied Players Non Combat Move is finished, use edit and place the appropiate Lend-Lease Unit with the corresponding Unit (this is optional and Players may choose to ignore this step). On Russia’s turn, purchase “AirLL” or "TankLL" for every Lend Lease Unit you want to accept. This will cost 1 PU per unit as well as 1 resource. The Soviets begin the game with 3 "Air" and 3 "Tank" resources. Once the resources are gone, they will be unable to purchase anymore "Air" or "Tank" LL units.<br>
<br>On First Place phase, place the appropriate "AirLL" or "TankLL" unit where the Lend Lease Unit is and then use edit to remove the Lend-lease Units and add the Soviet ones. The “AirLL” and "TankLL" Unit will remove itself before Combat Move.<br>
<br>
This is to maintain correct PU levels and keep track of how many Lend Lease Units have been sent.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If The Lend-Lease Units come under attack before Russia's turn, don't take the Lend-Lease image as a hit. It will auto die if the battle is lost.<br>
Player Enforced Unit Limits. You may want to use the "Comment Log" under View, Top left, to keep track of how many Units have been sent.<br>
<br>
<b>"US and UK Lend-Lease"</b> <br>
<br>
<b>This now works the same as the Soviet Lend Lease where you purchase the Lend lease Fee.</b>
<br>
Is On by Default at Game Start.<br>
<br>
Rules are here: https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/37806/global-1940-us-uk-lend-lease?_=1700781926910<br>
<br>
<b>9. Facilities</b><br>
<br>
<b>Underground Factories</b>.<br>
<img src="UndrgroundFctry.png"/> <br><br>
Purchase a Demolition Unit for Free on the turn you want to destroy them. You don’t have to use it, although you may want to place and edit the Factory back, so it won’t stay in your Purchased Units list if you don’t use it.<br>
<br>
You may <b>NOT</b> place and then Destroy on the same turn. Player Enforced.  Use edit to downgrade while moving.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
When replacing a Heavy Major or Minor Factory with an Underground Factory, you will need to use Edit. They will replace non upgraded Factories correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>Russian Factories</b>.<br> 
While the Factory can move on it's own, you will need to keep track of Rail movement usage. Player Enforced. They will auto-destroy when captured. Replace with edit if needed.<br>
<br>
You will need to use Edit to remove Airfields and Harbours. <br>
<br>
<b>Demolition of Airfields and Harbours</b>.<br><br>
<img src="demo_harbour.png"/>  <img src="demo_harbour.png"/>  <br><br>
These work correctly. Purchase the appropriate Demolition Unit and plant the explosives at the targeted Facility during the second Place Phase. The Facility will detonate at end turn. It will auto destruct before next enemy combat move.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Non-Agression Pacts</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to add units after combat move and adjust PU levels. Ignore second DOW notice when either Italy or Germany attack.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Strategic Bombing</b><br>
<br>
You can't designate certain Fighters to protect certain Facilities. The Air Battles will be fought in one battle.<br> 
So if you send 2 Fighter Escorts and 2 Bombers with 2 Interceptors defending and the Bombers are Bombing separate targets, there will be one Air Battle with all planes. You may choose your own Air casualties. Triplea will randomly select AA casualties. They will select Bombers or Tac Bombers only.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> You may roll the Air Battle and any Bombing with Dicebot or the Dice Roller for Full Rule compliance.<br>
<br>
<b>Section II</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. The Expanded Pacific Ocean</b><br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
This has been updated on <b>May 27 2024</B>.<br>
Has Not been tested extensively.<br>
Consult Game Rules and use Edit to correct as needed.<br>
<br>
In the Rare instance USA is in positon to enter Dutch New Guinea first, you will need to Player Enforce that it doesn't. <br><br>
Use Edit if needed.<br><br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>2. Increased Ship Building</b><br>
<br>
<img src="2Destroyers.png"/> <br><br>
Movement Restrictions are Player Enforced. The 2 Naval Fighters placed in "Late 1942" will always place. Use edit to correct Unit total if needed.<br>
<br>
May be turned off with map option "The Expanded Pacific Ocean".<br>
<br>
<b>3. Heavy Industry Production</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Hvy_Ind_2.png"/> <br><br>
Only Factories at Game Start can be upgraded. Player Enforced. Use First Place Phase and edit if necessary, when placing multiple upgrades at once.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Landmine</b><br>
<br>
<img src="russian_mine.png"/>   <img src="soloMine.png"/><br><br>
This requires extensive edit use. There is also a TripleA option that is "edit free" explained below.<br>
<br>
You may purchase "unarmed" mines and place them in your Capital and India for UK. <br> When placing in a damaged Factory, you may only place as many as there are placements available. You can't place the maximum of 10, unless there are 10 placements available.<br>
<br>
Use edit to place “Armed” mines. Use the Player “Changer” for these. You may place them anywhere there is an unarmed mine (including ones you purchased that turn). When you place the armed mines, you will need to use the “Comment Log” stating which Border they are defending in the territory. To access the comment log, go to the “View” menu, and click “Show Comment Log”.<br>
<br>
You may also place “Colored” mines: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Orange. This will allow you to edit different mines designating the defense of different borders. As a guideline, you may way want to use no color for West, Blue for North, Red for South and Yellow for East. Green for Northwest and Southeast and Orange for Southwest and Northeast to make it easier to tell how many and where they defend are.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
Some high use areas have border spefic LMs. When you hover on them, they will tell you which border they are defending. These Territories are for Germany<br>
112 Sea Zone<br>
Denmark<br>
Holland<br>
Norway<br>
Normandy<br>
West Germany<br>
<br>
For Russia<br>
Western Ukraine<br>
Belarus<br>
Ukraine<br>
Bryansk<br>
Rostov<br>
Caucasus<br>
Novgorod<br>
Archangel<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
<br>
Usually, after editing LMs, the next time you open edit, those LMs will have moved to the left column.<br>
<br>
If you can't find the LM your looking for, select another and document in Comment Log. Next turn, remove LM and then look for the LM you want.<br>
<br>
There are also LM Boxes that show the corresponding color for certain Borders. These are for informational purposes only.<br>
<br>
Using the mines in combat requires use of the "Dice Roller" or if playing by forum, dicebot. Follow these steps:<br><br>
Do your Entire Combat Move.<br>
Roll for any Landmines that have been crossed and make note of any hits.<br>
At the Beginning of Combat, if there were any LM hits, go to Edit and remove the appropriate units and LMs.<br>
Then, turn Edit off and fight the battle normally.<br><br>
If there is only one battle to be fought, you will need to be in Edit before you start Battle Phase, as triplea will immediately start the battle.<br>
<br>
Do not take mines as casualties in combat. Player enforced. When a territory is conquered, all the unarmed mines will be destroyed. Armed Changer mines will be unaffected.<br>
<br>
Use the same procedure as above, for any units that cross the minefield in non combat move.<br>
<br>
Mines will block blitz movement. Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" to make a legal move.<br>
<br>
<b>TripleA Landmines</b><br>
The “armed” mines are D2 now. They only die after getting a hit or taken as a casualty. They roll separately from the rest of the defending units, so you can see if they hit or not. You can place as many as there are “unarmed” mines, so you’ll have to player enforce any territory limits. They will defend against attacks from any border.<br>
<br> 
May be turned on in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>5. Escorts & Transports</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Escort_Convoy.png"/> <br><br>
Most Solo Escorts will now Auto change at End Turn. Use edit to place and remove the "Escort Convoy" unit(s) when Convoys are formed or dispersed when necessarry. Transports must be taken as casualties last. This is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
When attacking Submarines without a DD present, edit in Escort_ConvoyA<br><br><img src="Escort_ConvoyA.png"/> <br><br> These will not be able to attack Submarines. Edit back after battle if needed. <br>
<br>
Do not take Transports as casualties the first three rounds Player Enforced. You will have to kill them in battle, so you may want to quit battle and edit accordingly or continue battle till they're all dead.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> When Transports gain the ability to Defend, they still won't Block or Force a Naval Battle. They can still be ignored if by themselves. Triplea does this correctly.<br>
<br>
Also, if using Naval Mines, Escorts are considered Transports. You may need to use edit to bypass Submarines in some situations.<br>
It will ask if you want to atttack the Escort/Transport before battle as well.<br><br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>6. US National Guard</b><br>
<br>
The National Guard Units will deploy with any state of war with Japan. Use edit to remove them if illegally placed.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>7. Carrier Based Fighter Aircraft</b><br>
<br>
<img src="NavyFighter.png"/> <br><br>
Movement Restrictions are Player Enforced. Use edit for making legal landing moves when Carrier is sunk or damaged. If caught in land combat, use edit to remove them. If only 1 battle to take place that Combat Phase, you must edit  before starting combat move, then replace them if needed after combat.<br>
<br>
The 2 Naval Fighters placed in "Late 1942" will always place. Use edit to correct Unit total if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Defensive Fortifications</b><br>
<br>
Only place as many as there are Infantry present. Place in 2nd Place Phase only. These are Player Enforced.<br>
Do Not take as casualties. If they lose battle, they will auto die. If they win, remove any excess Fortifications with edit after combat.<br>
<br>
Use edit for Italy and Russia in the unlikely event they are needed.<br>
<br>
<b>9. German Atlantic Wall</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Atlantic_Wall.png"/> <br><br>
Only place as many as there are Infantry present. Place in 2nd Place Phase only. These are Player Enforced.<br>
Do Not take as casualties. If they lose battle, they will auto die. If they win, remove any excess Atlantic Wall units with edit after combat.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Capital Warships Taking Damage</b><br>
<br>
Don't attack with Damaged Carriers. Take Carriers as a hit over Battleships, when both are present. These are Player Enforced. Don't take "Defend CV Hit" as a casualty in Land Combat. This is also Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
1 "Repair Carrier" or "Repair BB" Unit will repair <b>All</b> Damaged Ships. Make sure to buy the appropriate amount of repair units. Player Enforced. They will auto die after combat move. Use edit to place in open sea. This may be fixed in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>This has been partially Fixed and they will now Place in Sea Zones that Border a Land Territory that you Control.</b> <br>
<br>
Purchase the Repair "Unit" and place in any legal spot First Place Phase to keep Correct PU total and then Edit A Repair Unit to the correct Sea Zone.<br>
<br>
Only scramble to the disabled Carrier's Sea Zone with the "Defend CV" Unit. Do not take as a hit in Land Combat. Do Not use any designated Fighters for other actions while on Carrier Defense Duty. These are all Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Place the "Defend CV" Unit during the 2nd Place Phase. It will auto remove before your next Purchase Phase.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If you didn't purchase a free Defend CV unit, simply edit one in after your turn.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Super Heavy Battleship</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Heavy_BB.png"/> <br><br>
The "SHB" will fire 2 Bombard shots, even if only 1 amphibous unit is attacking. Use the Dice Roller or Dicebot to Simulate the Bombardment and for any casualties to fire back. Then use edit to adjust accordingly. After that, do normal Battle without Bombarding during Combat. <br><br>
If you have more than 1 battle taking place, you will be able to use edit before choosing the first battle to fight. If only 1 battle is being fought, it will go straight to combat after your combat move. You will need to edit before your combat move in that case.<br>
<br>
"Repair_BB" will repair 1 hit point of damage for <b>ALL</b> Battleships, Heavy and non Heavy. If you have just a Heavy BB with 2 damage, it will repair it Fully, so you need to Player Enforce purchasing the correct amount of Repair Units. <br><br>
It Defaults to repairing a Battleship and not a Heavy BB if only 1 Repair Unit and both are present.
<br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
You need to edit to <b>"Hvy_BB_Dmgd" and "BB_Damaged"</b> before your next combat turn if needed and apply the appropriate amount of damage. This is so it can continue to attack in battle but not after battle when taking damage. Most BBs will repair, so will rarely be necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>Section III</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. US Armoured Infantry</b><br>
<br>
<img src="ArmoredInfantry.png"/> <br><br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. German Panzer Grenadiers</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Panzer_Grndrs.png"/> <br><br>
They work correctly except for Max Builds, which are Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Strategic Rail Movement</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Rail.png"/> <br><br>
Each Major Power's Rail Units will place before Combat Move. Germany, Russia, the United States and Italy, will place in their Capitals. Japan will place in Kiangsu, Britain will place in South Africa and China in Kansu. <br>
<br>You must control your Capital for units to place. China needs USA Capital. <br>
<br>
This is to help remind the Player of it's non combat move availability. They will not be able to move in combat move. The one with a "E" on it is for Europe movement. This is to keep track of rail movement. <br>
<br>
Rail Units are now Nation Specific and will only move where they are allowed to. You may still need to use edit in certain situations.<br><br>
Click on the Rail unit and then click the unit you want to move.<br>
<br>
Click on the Rail unit and then click the unit you want to move.<br>
<br>
Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" if necessary to make your move.<br>
<br> 
Correct movement is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
Kansu Rail will <b>Not</b> Place if Japanese controlled. Use Edit if needed to make legal Rail moves.<br>
<br>
Japanese Rail will not Place if All of China is Chinese controlled. Use edit to move Japanese units if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Home Defense</b><br>
<br>
<img src="HomeDefense.png"/> <br><br>
Use edit to place a "HomeDefense" token. It will place 2 Infantry for Japan and boost the Infantry and Fighters by 1 on defense for the first round only for UK and Japan.<br>
It will then auto remove after first round of battle and the remaining units will revert to their normal defense factor.
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Landing Craft</b><br>
<br>
<img src="USA_LCV.png"/> <br><br>
Only take as casualty when Attacking in Land Battles. They will Auto Die when only units left in battle. Player Enforced. Roll Scramble Battles in the Dice Roller <b>before</b> starting Combat Phase.<br>
<br>
Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" for movement across Sea Zones. You will need to click on the units it's carrying as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
 If accompanied by Air Units during an attack, you won't be able to retreat Air Units during battle. If necessary, save game, reroll battle accordingly using the triplea Dice Roller located in "View" top left of screen and then edit correct outcome or<b> do the battle in Edit mode</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>6. D-Day</b><br>
<br>
<img src="D-Day.png"/> <br><br>
Purchase a "DDayEurope" Token <br><br>
<img src="DDayEurope.png"/> <br><br>and place during first Place Phase in USA.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You may now move the "D-Day" Token from the "Early 1944" Box in NCM, making purchase of the token unnecessary.<br><br>
Move all USA Land Units to participate in D-Day, including DDayEurope Token ( this isn't required but is helpful for information purposes ), to D-Day Box during USA Non Combat Move Phase using Edit "Perform Move or Other Actions". <br>Once you click on "Perform Move or Other Actions" you may perform multiple moves, even if they aren't all at once. In other words, you don't need to click on "Perform Move or Other Actions" for every move.<br><br>
<b>Note</b><br>
The "DDayEurope" Token is American controlled. <b>DO NOT</b> move it into Battle first or none of the British Units will be able to attack. You'll be able to move them but they won't take part in the battle.<br><br>
You may move Air Units to the "D-Day Box" as well, but only the Bomber will auto change to British control. Some Land Units will also not change to British control. Armour, LCVs, Paratroopers, Engineers, Armored Infantry, Tank Generals, Marines ( use Commandos ) will need to be changed using Edit.<br><br>
Any Transports or Capital Ships that will Bombard, will also need to be changed with Edit.<br><br>
Use Comment log if necessary to document which Units have been changed. You can also refer to "History" as well. Finish the rest of USA's turn.<br>
<br>
On UK turn, change the USA Units that didn't change in the D-Day Box to UK ( use "artilleryTG" for ArmoredInfantry ) control. Use Edit to move the Units in the "D-Day Box" into Battle.<br>
It is not necessary to move the DDay Europe Token to the Territory being Attacked and it will auto remove itself before Italy's turn no matter where it is on the Game Board. Do not take it as a casualty during battle. Player Enforced.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You need to land the <b>Non Edited Air Units</b> before the ones moved with Edit or it will say you don't have enough range. So it'd probably be best to Edit the Air Units to UK instead of D-Day Box or use Edit to land them.<br><br>
Use History or the comment log if needed for a reference when editing the Units back to USA control.<br>
<br>
It's an involved turn, but only happens once a game, so not game breaking. Hopefully someone will redraw the map in the future, adding a D-Day box, as well as boxes for the Army Groups and Corps.<br>
<br>
<b>Boxes have been added</b>.<br>
<br>
Automatic change from USA to UK may be added in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>This has been partially implemented.</b><br><br>
<b>This is still in the Testing Phase, so use Edit as needed for Correct Game Play.</b><br><br>
<b>7. Red Army Conscription</b><br>
<br>
<img src="RedArmyConscript.png"/> <br><br>
Placement Restrictions Player Enforced. So no more than 20 in Moscow and 6 in the Stalingrad Factories. May Place 3 for normal place in other Factories.<br> Max build of 26 <b>is</b> Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
May Max Place Regardless of Factory Damage.<br><br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>8. German U-boats</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Wolfpack.png"/> <br><br>
<b>NOTE<br><br>
New Wolfpack Procedure as of May 10 2024.</b><br>
<br>
"Wolfpack" units are A0 D0 C0 units with unlimited movement. They provide a plus 1 on Attack and plus 2 on Defense to <B>ALL</b> U-Boats.<br>
Triplea will auto place and remove Wolfpacks before the start of combat. In rare instances you may need to Player Enforce usage. A "Wolfpack" is only formed when there are 3 or more U-Boats in same Sea Zone.<br>
<br>
They will auto sink after first round of combat rolls. <br>
<br>
If a Wolfpack is attacked by Enemy Submarines and there is no Destroyer present to defend them, any First Strike hits that would leave the Wolfpack with less than 3 U-Boats, will not remove the Wolpack combat bonus.<br>
In that case, you will need to fight the battle in edit or for a larger battle, use dicebot/roller and edit accordingly.<br>
<br><b>NOTE</b><br>
<br>
If attacking with Air and Submarine/U-boats, triplea will ask if you want to retreat the Air or submerge the Subs.<br>
This is incorrect as you <b>MUST</b> Retreat all attacking units at the same time.<br>
<br>
<b>9. Waffen Paratroopers</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Waffen_Para.png"/> <br><br>
Move 3 with +1 from Airfield. Player Enforce correct land movement of 1 move only. Use Dice Roller for AA fire. You may need to use edit to make combat or non combat moves with "Perform Move or Other Actions" same as Wehrmacht Paratroopers. If still not possible to make legal move, edit directly at start of phase. May not Air Attack Capitals. Player Enforced. Max Builds Player Enforced. They <b>are</b> supported by Waffen Artillery.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>10. Waffen Artillery</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Waffen_Arty.png"/> <br><br>
Edit to "Waffen_ArtyPG" <img src="Waffen_ArtyPG.png"/> when inside of a Waffen Army that only has Waffen Panzers, so it doesn't use it's artillery support bonus for the Oberst.<br>
Also edit when Waffen Arty is Not part of the Waffen Army and has no Waffen Units to support.<br>
<br>
This may <b>Rarely</b> result in Battle that a Active Waffen Arty, due to combat losses, would end up supporting a Unit Inside the Army.<br>
If needed, you can roll the Battle in Edit for exact Game Play results.<br>
<br>
<b>Section IV</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. Soviet Tank Mass Production </b><br>
<br>
<img src="Mass_Tanks.png"/> <br><br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Waffen Panzer Grenadiers</b><br>
<br>
<img src="WaffenPnzrGrndr.png"/> <br><br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Otherwise they work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Waffen Oberst-Gruppenführer</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Waffen_Oberst.png"/> <br><br>
There are "4" Oberst. The one you can purchase is not currently in command of a Waffen Army. Depending on the configuration of the Army, use edit to replace the Oberst with a "2", "3" or "4" Oberst. This will boost the appropriate A2, A3 and A4 units.<br>
<br>
Always take the Oberst as the First casualty of the Army. Otherwise it will continue to roll twice and give it's bonus roll to the designated unit.<br>
<br>
Use edit to replace a Waffen Army unit that survives and retreats, with the Oberst who was killed, if needed for regrouping in non combat move.<br>
<br>
For example. You have 2 Waffen Infantry, a Waffen Panzer and a Oberst. You decide to create a Waffen Army with the Oberst giving it's bonus roll to the Panzer by using edit to replace the Oberst with "Oberst 4" <b>before</b> the start of your combat move.<br>
<br>
When more than 1 Waffen Army is present in a territory, only 1 Army can use it's bonus rolls. Use regular Oberst for other Armies.<br>
When attacking, all units in the Army must start in same territory. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
When Defending in Berlin, Moscow or Washington, you may have <b>2 Active Armies</b><br><br>
<b>4. Soviet Commissar</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Soviet_Commisar.png"/> <br><br>
They behave the same as the Waffen Oberst-Gruppenführer.<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberTG" <img src="tactical_bomberTG.png"/> and "artilleryTG" <img src="artilleryTG.png"/> before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support nor support Infantry Units.<br>
<br>
I don't know that the "artilleryTG/PG" are actually needed, but if they are, there available :)<br>
<br>
Also Don't think Tactical Bmbr PG/TGs will be needed that often.<br>
Idk how often this would come up. Probably only if you have a Tank Army with a bunch of INF and no extra Tanks to support. <br>
<br>
Also AA could possibly affect it if paired with FTR, so should take Tac as hit in that case. If no extra Tanks to support.
<br><br>
There will be some rare overlap, say all the INF get killed and you kill the FTR the Tac is paired with so when the existing Tank Army disbands the Tac can continue to give support.
<br><br>
So you might get 1 rd of a 4 instead of 3. Triplea limitations. I guess we’ll just have to live with them. :) <br>
<br>
<b>5. Panzer General</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Panzer_General.png"/> <br><br>
Only build 1 per turn. Player Enforced. Use the Oberst and Commisar procedure for correct game play. Panzer General3 is the combat active one.<br>
<br>
When in Combat, Kill the PG first if you won't have enough units left to keep the Army active, otherwise it will continue to give bonus. Use edit to replace after battle if needed.<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberPG/TG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br><br>
If a Tactical Bomber is present with other Tanks Not part of the Tank Army at start of Battle, Kill the Tac Bmbr and leave a Tank alive instead so the Tac Bmbr will not give it's bonus to the Tank Army if needed.<br>
<br>
Edit the Tac Bmbr back in after battle if the Tank it took the hit for survives. Should be a rare occurrence.<br><br>
<b>6. Army Group</b><br>
<br>
<img src="ArmyGroupCentre.png"/> <br><br>
There are 2 Flags. "Army Group Active" is the Flag for receiving the combat bonus.<br>
<br>
If the Army Group will disband after a round of combat, you must kill the Army Group or it will continue to attack. Flags will take a hit. This is unintended. It is suggested to give the defending territory an "Inactive" Army Group Flag if no Army Group is present in order to offset the hit from the attacking Flag. Do not take as casualty until after the attacking Flag is chosen as a casualty.<br>
<br>
Or to be rule compliant you may roll the battle in edit. This actually works quite well as you generally have to change some of the triplea casualty selections anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
The Army Group Does Not provide a Movement Bonus to the Units in the AG. They must still move at their allotted amount.<br>
<br>
<b>7. German Take Over of Italy</b><br>
<br>
<img src="TakeOverItaly.png"/> <br><br>
On Italy's Turn prior to being Taken Over, Buy a "TakeOverItaly" Token. If conditions are not met for Take Over of Italy after Non Combat Move, Do Not Place. Otherwise, place in Southern Italy during 2nd Place Phase.<br>
This will Auto change <b>Most</b> Italian Units and Territories to German. <br>
Use Edit for any that did not correctly change. Infrastructure will remove in Northern and Southern Italy only and be replaced beginning of German turn. Use edit for any other Italian owned Infrastructure.<br><br>
In the off chance France or ANZAC wanted to Attack Italian Infrastructure, use Edit for correct Game Play.<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
<br>
Italy will <b>Not</b> collect income at end of it's turn. You will have to add up their income and add it via edit before they finish placement. You will also have to hand roll for any Blockade damage and adjust accordingly.<br>
<br>
On Germany's turn, pay the 5 PUs to the Bank when prompted. You will also need to Edit the Italian PUs to German and adjust any Damage to Facilities. <br><br>
The extra Para and LCV build limits are Player Enforced. National Objectives will not show up in the Objectives tab. They will be listed at end of turn and in History.<br>
<br>
For First turn Italy is Taken Over, Buy Mech Infantry instead of Paras if needed. Correct with Edit after Placement.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Total War</b><br>
<br>
<img src="TotalWar.png"/> <br><br>
Placement number is Player Enforced. Only place during 2nd plase phase or they won't change. If unable to place in a legal spot, use edit. This should be a rare occurence.<br> <b>Note</b> If Russia buys more than one Total War Tank, use Edit to Correct PU's or Units, as you can only use the "Mass Tank" build once and there is no other Total War Tank build.
<br>
<br>
<b>9. Air Transport</b><br>
<br>
<img src="air_transport.png"/> <br><br>
Movement is Player Enforced. They can move 6, or 7 with Airfield, whether loaded or not. Only Germany may transport Panzers or Panzer rated units. <br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
They won't reset if you select from all units. Best to load one at a time. May need to restart game if unable to edit correct behavior.<br>
<br>
<b>Section V Optional Rules</b><br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options" before Game Start.<br>
<br> 
<b>1. Soviet Partisans</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Soviet_Partisan.png"/> <br><br>
You can purchase and place in any soviet controlled territory. You will need to then use edit, to place where you want and remove. This is to keep track of PU levels.<br>
<br>
You need to use edit to kill/remove any Partisans your units come into contact with. Also to change from 2 Partisans to 1 Infantry.<br> 
<br>
If only 1 Partisan in territory, it will conquer it during combat phase. You will need to edit desired results.<br>
<br>
<b>2. German Volkssturm</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Volkssturm.png"/> <br><br>
When conditions are met, save game and before restarting, turn on in Map options. You will need to do this before the end of France's turn or the Option won't go into affect until the next round. You can either turn on and off as needed, or Player Enforce if conditions no longer legal.<br>
<br>
<b>3. German Me 262 Jet Fighter</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Me262.png"/> <br><br>
These work correctly. 
<br>
<br>
<b>4. German King Tiger Tank</b><br>
<br>
<img src="King_Tiger.png"/> <br><br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Per turn build of 3, is Player Enforced. They can be repaired anywhere. Use the above procedure for repairing Battleships and Carriers.<br>
Repair unit will not repair Battleship or Carrier.
<br>
<br>
It is actually easier to use edit for the repairs, as their combat values do not change the way Battleships do. <br>
<br>
<b>5. Waffen Heavy Tank</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Waffen_Hvy_Tank.png"/> <br><br>
These work correctly. Use same repair procedure as above. Uses same place procedure as other Waffen Units.
<br>
<br>
<b>6. Japanese Banzai Attack</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Banzai.png"/> <br><br>
Will auto place 1 Banzai unit per turn in Japan. Has unlimited movement. Do not take as casualty in battle. Use only for legal attacks. Player Enforced.<br>
Will auto die at End Turn.
<br>
<br>
<b>7. British Seafire Fighter Planes</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Seafire.png"/> <br><br>
Requires same Player Enforced and edit use as USA and Japan Navy Fighters listed above.
<br>
<br>
<b>8. German Me-109T Fighter Planes</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Me_109T.png"/> <br><br>
Requires same Player Enforced and edit use as USA and Japan Navy Fighters listed above.
<br>
<br>
<b>9. Japanese Destroyers</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Japan_destroyer.png"/> <br><br>
<b>Note</b><br>
Triplea will always load Infanty to Destroyer first. Load 1 at a time and use edit if needed.<br>
<br>
Only load with Infantry and Elite infantry. Player Enforced.
<br>
<br>
<b>10. Rockets</b><br>
<br>
<img src="German_Rockets.png"/> <br><br>
Only move 1 space in NCM. Do not take as casualty. Player Enforced. Will auto die if only units left.
<br>
<br>
If Attacking a Army/Corps or Army Group, do the Rocket Attacks with Dicebot or the Dice Roller before Battle if needed, so you can adjust casualties Before Combat Starts.<br>
<br>
When placing in a damaged Factory, you may only place as many as there are placements available. You can't place the maximum of 10, unless there are 10 placements available.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Bidding</b><br>
<br>
Player Enforced. :)
<br>
<br>
<b>12. US Heavy Transport</b><br>
<br>
<img src="USAHeavyTransport.png"/> <br><br>
Player Enforce no more than 2 Tanks, AA Guns, Combat Engineers or Paratroopers per Transport.
<br>
<br>
<b>13. German Type XXI U-boats</b><br>
<br>
<img src="Type_XXI_UBoat.png"/> <br><br>
<b>When Type XXI U-boats are atttacking by themselves, roll the battle in Edit Mode.</b><br>
This will allow you to ignore any Defender Hits if you are going to withdraw after 1st round of Battle.<br>
<br>
If part of a multi Vessel Attack, they will work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>14. Heavy Bombers</b><br>
<br>
Infrastructure AA will still Fire at them. Regular combat won't. Use Edit to correct if needed.
<br>
<br>
<b>15. Basic Expansion Rules</b><br>
<br>
Changes to the Basic Expansion Rules. Russian Conscription may only build 12 total now. Germany, Japan, USA, when at war, and UK all recieve 6 PUs for Advanced Production now. Italy receives nothing. 
<br>
<br>
You will need to turn off in Map Options ,or ignore, "Expanded Pacific Ocean", "National Guard" and "Total War".<br>
<br>
Waffen Artillery, Wolfpacks and Landing Craft will show up in the Purchase Window. They should be ignored.<br>

<br>
France will also place 4 Infantry regardless of it's Factory damage. Use edit if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>17. Desert Army</b><br>
<br>
<img src="DAK.png"/> <br><br>
Adds the Desert Army Unit. Once the Desert Army is Formed, you will need to edit the correct DesertGeneral. Use "DesertGeneral3" with Tank Units. "DesertGeneral2" with Artillery. Use "DesertGeneralA2D3" for Panzer Grenadier and Armoured Infantry Units. Use"DesertGeneral" for all other Units.<br>
<br>
Move Restrictions are Player Enforced. This may be fixed in the future.
<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberPG/TG" and "artilleryPG/TG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support nor support Infantry Units.<br>
<br>
<b>18. Combat Engineer</b><br>
<br>
<img src="German_Engineer.png"/> <br><br>
Adds the Combat Engineer Unit. Use Edit for moving Minor Factories and removing Landmines. Also for landing at Landing Strips. Land the Air Unit in a legal area and then edit after Non Combat Move. Unit Image courtesy of Hepps.

<img src="German_EngineerAttack.png"/> <br><br>
You will need to Edit before Combat replacing it's counterpart. It will only conduct Combat Operations of "Blitz with Tank" and A2 when paired with Artillery.<br>
<br>
This is only needed for Attacking. The other Engineers will defend correctly as well as the "Attack" Engineer.<br>
Use Edit to replace as needed.<br>

<b>20. US and UK Lend-Lease</b><br>
<br>
This has no affect on Game Play. It just adds a "Game Option" for a simple way for Players to agree to using the Optional rule. It may be expanded in the future.<br>
Is On by Default at Game Start.<br>
<br>
Here are the Rules. They are discussed here: https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/37806/global-1940-us-uk-lend-lease?_=1698425091945
<br>
<br>
From the beginning of the US player’s turn in Late 1941 the United States can send up to 3 Air Units (all types of Air Units are included) to the United KIngdom.<br>
Even if the United States is not at War.<br>
<br>
Exception: Aircraft Carrier Based Fighter units cannot be part of the US & UK Lend-Lease rule.<br>
<br>
From the beginning of the US player’s turn in Late 1941 the United States can send up to 3 Naval Units to the United Kingdom as part of the Lend-Lease program.<br>
The Naval Units included are Destroyer units and/or Escort units.<br>
<br>
The overall rule concerning these Lend-Lease units:<br>
<br>
US Air units must be converted to UK Air units in the United Kingdom Territory.<br>
US Naval units must be converted to UK Naval units in sz 109 and/or sz 119.<br>
<br>
The rules must follow the same game mechanisms that applies to the Lend-Lease rules concerning the Soviet Union (see the Axis & Allies Global 1940 House Rules Expansion page 19).<br>
<br>
In other words:<br>
<br>
The US units cannot take part in any Combat during the US player’s turn before being converted to UK units.<br>
The UK player must pay 1 IPC for each Lend-Lease unit.<br>
The US units must be converted to UK units on the first coming UK player’s turn.<br>
If the US units are attacked before they are converted to UK units, they defend as usual. If these units are destroyed in Combat before they are converted to UK units, they do not count as Lend-Lease units - and the US player can therefore send new Lend-Lease units to the UK player.<br>

This has no affect on Game Play. It just adds a "Game Option" for a simple way for Players to agree to using the Optional rule.<br>
Is On by Default at Game Start.<br>
<br>Here are the Rules. They are discussed here <br><br>

<br>
<br>
The Kamikaze Tokens that come with the G40 OOB rules are no longer used<br>
From Late 1944 Japan can launch Kamikaze attacks<br>
Japanese Kamikaze attacks can be launched anywhere on the game board<br>
Japan can launch a maximum of 1 Kamikaze attack in each round<br>
The Japanese player must choose a Japanese Air Unit to be used in a Kamikaze attack<br>
The Kamikaze Air Unit must be one of the following Air Units: Fighter, Tactical Bomber, Strategic Bomber<br>
The Kamikaze Air Unit can use up all its movement to reach an enemy Target Naval Unit<br>
The enemy naval unit that is attacked by Japanese Kamikaze must be the same type of naval units as mentioned in the G40 OOB rulebook<br>
The Japanese Kamikaze Air Unit attacks at “5”<br>
There is no defense against a Japanese Kamikaze attack<br>
<br>
Beginning Rd 10, A Kamikaze Unit will auto spawn the same way as the Banzai unit and work similar.<br>

https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/36945/axis-allies-global-1940-house-rules-expansion/592
<br>
<br>
You will need to remove any AA Guns and replace with "aaGunNO".<br>
<br>
<img src="aaGunNO.png"/> <br><br>
Can be taken as a hit but will not fire at planes.<br>
<br>
The Tower has Max Damage of 6. This allows you to take the 5 Hit Points of Damage without killing it. One repair unit will fix <b>All</b> damage, so Player enforce the correct amount.<br>
<br><b> You need to roll All AA shots for Fighter Units with Dice roller before battle and edit accordingly.<br>
It will Fire at All Bombers, except Heavy Bombers, correctly at 2. </b><br>
<br>
By Rule they Fire at <b>ALL</b> planes. 1 at Fighters and 2 at Tac Bmbrs and Bmbrs.<br>
<br>
It can't be captured, so kill as last unit left, then edit it and the damage back in to the Victor.<br>

<br>
Purchase a "Take Over Spain" Token, place in Germany in 1st place phase and Declare War on the Neutrals.<br>
The Neutral Spainards will remove before combat and be replaced with Neutral Axis after combat.<br><br>
Rules are Player Enforced. <br><br>
<b>Unofficial SBR Option</b><br>
<br>
This is independent of the Captain and Company's Awesome House Rules, thus "Unofficial". :) 
May be turned on in "Map Options".<br>
Bombers are now a A0 D0 M6 +1 w/AB C5 unit. They may perform SBR attacks only. They have no Air Battle Attack Factor but can be taken as casualties in the Air Battle with Interceptors. They do 1-6 damage. They no longer receive +2 to an SBR attack.<br>
<br>
Fighters now Air battle at Attack 1 on Escort and Defend 2 on Intercept. Tactical Bombers now Air Battle at attack 1.
<br>
<br>
If defending in a Land Combat, do not take as casualty. Player enforced. <br>
If you receive a Notification that says "Units in Following Territories will Die". Ignore this and hit "Done Moving". This will be fixed in the future.<br>
<br>
This has no effect on "Heavy Bombers".<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
<br>
You may manipulate the number of Air battle rounds in "Map Options" before Game Start, as well as, "Attacker" "Defender" retreat.<br>
I suggest using with the default "Expansion" rules, which are unlimited.<br>
<br>
You can also Bomb Underground Factories. Max damage to a Major is 7 and a Minor 2. So the major will be able to produce 3 units at max damage and a minor 1. Heavy Industry has 8 max damage to a major, Minor remains at 2. So 4 and 2 for their minimum builds.<br>
<br>
This represents bombing of transportation lines to the Factories and to encourage more SBR's.<br>
<br>
<b>Unofficial "Normandy Original Owner Pro Neutral Allies"</b><br>
When France is Liberated, Normandy Bordeaux will no longer turn French.<br><br>
<b>Victory Conditions</b><br>

<b>18)Unofficial "Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
<br>
You may use this for <b>"Visual"</b> purposes only and use Edit for correct "Out of Box" rules behavior.<br>
<br>
Adds "Charles de Gaulle Neutrals" (Only "Modified" option is available).<br>Discussed in detail here:<b>https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/28180/should-we-make-better-rules-for-invadable-neutrals-1940/4?page=1</b><br><br>
Check the box in "Map Options" before game start. You will need to declare war against the True Neutrals in order to attack them. You will need to <b>Player Enforce</b> correct "Neutral" behavior if needed. <br><br> 
Neutral Ships don’t affect naval at all, unless you are attacking them. Neutral Navies are represented with a "Neutral_Navy" <img src="Neutral_Navy.png"/> unit placed in their Home country. <b>Hover over the Naval symbol and it will show where the Ships deploy.</b> You will need to <b>Edit</b> the appropriate number of Ships <b>Before</b> your Combat Move.<br><br>
When attacking a Neutral, the units written here are immediately placed in the attacked territory as well as any territories aligned to them (triplea does this automatically). The opposing team will pick a player<b> Player Enforced</b> to represent those forces and collect income from any of their territories you failed to take. So, after combat, use edit to change any surviving units and the territory itself, to the Player of your choice.<br>
<br>
The neutrals which have more than one territory are:<br>
Mongolia (use OOB rules for this one)<br>
Portugal: Portugal, Portuguese Giunea, Angola, Mozambique<br>
Spain: Spain, Rio de Oro<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
If Russia attacks Amur or Korea and the Japanese then Declare War on Mongolia, the Mongolian Infantry will immediately turn Russian <b>BUT</b> the Territories will become Pro Allied. <br>
<br>
The new neutral setup is:<br>
<br>
Venezuela: 6 infantry<br>
Colombia: 1 infantry<br>
Ecuador: 1 infantry<br>
Peru: 1 infantry<br>
Bolivia: 1 infantry<br>
Paraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Uraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Argentina: 6 infantry<br>
SZ 66 (aligned with Argentina): 1 cruiser<br>
Chile: 4 infantry<br>
Mozambique: 2 infantry<br>
Angola: 2 infantry<br>
Portugal: 4 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 104 (aligned with Portugal): 1 cruiser, 1 transport<br>
Spain: 10 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 tank, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 92 (aligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
SZ 91 (aligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
Switzerland: 6 infantry<br>
Sweden: 6 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 114 (aligned with Sweden): 1 destroyer<br>
Turkey: 8 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 99 (aligned with Turkey): 1 destroyer<br>
Arabia: 6 infantry<br>
Afghanistan: 4 infantry<br><br>

<b>"Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b>.<br>
Changes the unit setup for:<br>
Poland: -2 infantry adds 1 fighter<br>
Switzerland: -2 infantry adds 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
Venezuela: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>
Argentina: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>

<b>BM Rules</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>**REVISIONS**</b><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Revised Air Raid Rules:</b> Fighters attack and defend at 2. Strategic and tactical bombers attack at 1.<br><br>

<b>Revised Capital Capture Rules:</b> The capture of a player's capital results in the plunder of that player's PUs only the <b>first</b> time the capital is taken. Subsequent recapture of the same capital results in the player's PUs being destroyed.<br><br>

<b>Revised Victory Conditions:</b> If Germany is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in the Pacific requires 7 (rather than 6) Pacific VCs. If Japan is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in Europe requires 9 (rather than 8) Europe VCs. 

<br><br>
<b>Revised Bomber Cost:</b> Strategic bombers now cost 14 PUs, rather than 12. <br><br>

<b>New Unit - Marines:</b> Cost 5; Attack at 1 (2 during amphibious assaults); Defend at 2; No bonus from artillery; Can be loaded onto cruisers and battleships (1 to a ship). <br><br>
<b>Note:</b> During amphibious assaults, Battleships and Cruisers may bombard any adjacent territory in which an amphibious assault is occurring, regardless of where they unloaded their marines.

<br><br>

<b>Additional National Objectives</b><br><br>

<b>Germany</b>
<ul>
<li>2 PUs if Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Crete are Axis or Pro-Axis controlled.</li>
<li>5 PUs if there is at least one German land unit in either London (the United Kingdom) or Egypt. (This modifies Germany's "Presence in Egypt" objective).</li>
</ul>
<b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if Russia is at war with European Axis, and there are no non-Russian Allied units in any originally Russian territory.</li>
<li>3 PUs for each originally German, Italian, or Pro-Axis neutral territory that Russia controls <b>in mainland Europe.</b> (This modifies Russia's "Spread of Communism" objective). </li>
<li>2 PUs for each of the following Lend-Lease lanes that is "open" (i.e., the specified Sea Zone has no enemy warships and the specified territory is Allied controlled) when Russia is at war with European Axis beyond Round 2: (1) sz 125, Archangel ; (2) sz 80, Persia; (3) sz 5, Amur (This modifies Russia's "Lend Lease" objective).</li>
<li>An additional 2 PUs per each "open" Lend-Lease lane, when Russia is at war with European Axis, if Japan has also declared war on Russia.</li> 
<br>
<b>Note:</b> An Axis power may not move its units into originally Russian territory unless that Axis power is at war with Russia. Also, when not at war with Japan, Russia may not move its units into any non-Russian Allied territory in Asia, other than Syria, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Persia, NorthWest Persia, and East Persia. The National Objective for Russia's first capture of Berlin has been removed.
</ul>

<b>Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>5 PUs if Axis controls Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea, New Britain and Solomon Islands. (This modifies Japan's "Strategic Perimeter" objective).</li>

</ul>

<b>China</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if Allies control Yunnan, Szechwan, Burma, and India. (This modifies China's "Burma Road" objective).</li>

These "guerrillas" engage in combat wherever they are spawned and may not be moved until China's next turn. </li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<b>**VICHY FRANCE RULE SET**</b>
<br><br>
The following rule-set simulates the circumstances and strategic consequences of the Franco-German Armistice, and is intended for play with the G40 Balance Mod.
<br><br>
<b>Game Conditions for Franco-German Armistice</b> 
<br><br>
At the beginning of France's turn, if the following conditions are met, the Franco-German Armistice will occur:
<br><br>
1. Axis has control of both France and Normandy Bordeaux;<br>
2. Axis has never controlled Southern France; and<br>
3. There are no non-French, Allied land units in Southern France.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Game Consequences of Franco-German Armistice</b>
<br><br>
<b>French Territorial Control:</b> At the beginning of France's first turn in which Armistice conditions are met, all originally French territories not already under Axis control immediately change ownership to Pro-Axis Neutrals, except: (1) French Equatorial Africa; (2) New Hebrides; (2) any French territories containing non-French allied land units.
<br><br>
Any non-French allied air units in Vichy-controlled territory are destroyed upon conversion of the territory to Vichy control.
<br><br>
With the exception of Southern France (see discussion of "Zone Libere" below), Vichy French territory operates the same way as other Pro-Axis Neutral territory. An Axis player may capture Vichy French territory and commandeer its forces by moving a land unit into the territory during the non-combat phase of his turn.
<br><br>
Fly-over restrictions applicable to other Neutral territories do not apply to Vichy French territory.
<br><br>
<b>Fleet at Toulon:</b> In addition to the change in French territorial control, the Armistice changes control of the the French fleet in sz 93, from French to Pro-Axis neutral. The Vichy French fleet maintains a strictly defensive posture. It may not be moved. It may not be captured by the Axis. The fleet is immediately destroyed if any power, other than the Free French, occupies Southern France 
<br><br>
<b>"Zone Libre":</b> Any Axis occupation of Southern France following the Armistice results in the scuttling of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon and the disbandment of all remaining Vichy French forces. These forces are removed at the end of the Axis player's turn in which the occupation of Southern France takes place. Any formerly Vichy French forces that were previously commandeered by the Axis are unaffected by this change.
<br><br>
<b>Armistice's Effect on National Objectives:</b> Following the armistice, Southern France is considered Axis-controlled for purposes of Italy's "Roman Empire" objective. Otherwise, the Vichy France arrangement has no impact on National Objectives. Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco must still be directly occupied by Germany or Italy to achieve Italy's "North Africa" objective. Japanese occupation of French Indo China still negates Japan's "Trade With America" objective. 
<br><br>
<b>Liberation of France:</b> The Allied liberation of France effectively terminates the Armistice. Any territory and forces still under Vichy French control (including any surviving fleet in sz 93) revert back to Free French control. The Vichy French forces in the Southern France and sz 93 will also revert back if Southern France is liberated by the Free French. 
<br><br>
<br><hr><br>
<b>Note</b><br>
This game uses the latest Global 1940 2nd Edition (successor to Alpha +3) rules, as posted on Larry's website.<br>
To blitz move mech_infantry with armour, you must click on them both at the same time (use CTRL to create waypoints).<br>
Paratroopers tech enables a second combat movement phase which happens right after the first combat movement phase, and the second one only allowes movement of paratrooping infantry.<br>
<br>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
The game is not meant to take over your responsibility in knowing the rules. For example, the game engine is not always going to restrict or allow certain attacks. 
It is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them. Most of the game notes that follow can be thought of as differences compared to WWIIv3 or WWIIv4 rules but obviously are not a complete manual for the game. 
Beginners to these games are suggested to ask for help in the lobby or on the forums at http://www.tripleawarclub.org<br>
You must always validate your own movement, especially air movement at sea.  The engine is not perfect.<br>
<br>

<b>Edit Mode</b><br>
If you ever need to create new UK units, always create "British" units, do not create "UK_Pacific" units (except for Factories and facilities, all UK_Pacific units turn into British units when placed normally).<br>
The Warbonds technology will give the PUs to the British, please use edit mode if you want some of it to go to UK Pacific.<br>
You may also need to use edit mode to correct things listed below.<br>
<br>

<br>Below is a list of rules that the TripleA game engine either does not enforce, or enforces incorrectly, at this point.
<br>Each item starts with a code in parentheses that represents how you may fix or correct the rule.
<br>(PE) = Player Enforced = You must be aware of the rule and must follow it. The engine will not stop you from breaking the rule.
<br>(CL) = Comment Log = You must record what you are doing in the comment log, because TripleA does not keep that information around. (To access the comment log, go to the 'view' menu, and click 'show comment log', then type a comment there.)
<br>(SR) = Save/Reload = You may save the game now or at the start of the phase, then reload it, in order to solve this problem.
<br>(EM) = Edit Mode = You must use Edit Mode to correct or fix the error, because the engine either disallows the rule or otherwise does something wrong that you can correct.
<br>(NA) = None Available = There is no fix available for this yet.
<br>
<br><b>Rules specific to 1940 the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (EM) You may ask for permission during your turn to move through a canal owned by a power you are not yet at war with (use edit mode to move them).
<br>* (CL) TripleA does not keep track of which neutral territories have been previously attacked (use comment log to keep track of this instead).
<br>* (PE) You are not allowed to blitz or move any units through Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You may not land air units in Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You can not fly over unfriendly neutrals, unless they are being attacked or they have previously been attacked.
<br>* (PE) Friendly Neutrals can not be 'captured' with an AA Gun, only by land units with an attack power.
<br>* (PE) You may not build facilities on territories that were Dutch at the start of your turn.
<br>* (PE) You may not attack a territory containing units owned by a nation that you are not at war with (even if the territory is owned by someone you are at war with).
<br>* (PE) USA may not end movement in seazone adjacent to Japanese controlled territories when not at war with Japan (Sea Zones 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 33, 34, 36, and 37).
<br>* (EM) Japan can fly over UK and French territories before going to war with them.
<br>* (EM) USA does not have to declare war at the end of USA 3 if they do not want to.
<br>* (PE) You may not conduct an amphibious assault from an allied transport if the defender could scramble and you have no other combat units to protect that transport.
<br>* (EM) If Russia is at war with Italy, but not with Germany, a German warship in sz125 will cancel Russia's national objective (and same if at war with Germany but not Italy, and there is an Italian boat in sz125).
<br>* (EM) If UK Pacific captures Japan, the money should go to UK Pacific, even if UK Pacific's capital is occupied.
<br>* (EM) You must place all units you purchased if you are able to, or as many as you can. Any units not placed get refunded to you (TripleA instead carries them over to the next turn).
<br>* (PE) The victory conditions must be held for a full continuous round after they are achieved (so for example if Italy takes Egypt as the 8th European VC, then the Axis must hold 8 VCs continuously until Italy's next turn).
<br>* (EM) Rocket damage to an airfield should occur after scrambling, which means if an airbase is disabled by the rocket attack, it could still scramble this turn.
<br>* (PE) Paratroopers (airborne) may not attack multiple territories from a single airbase.
<br>
<br><b>General rules for all A&A games that the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (PE) Battles should be resolved in this order: all SBR, then all Amphibious Assaults, then all others.
<br>* (SR or EM) Repairing and Purchase are should actually be done at the same time.
<br>* (CL) TripleA does keep track of which units are on which transports, but there is no easy way to see this information when it is not your turn.
<br>* (CL) TripleA should, but does not keep track of which air units are on which carriers.
<br>* (PE) All air moved must have a way of potentially being picked up or landing, and all air that survives combat MUST be picked up if possible.
<br>* (PE) TripleA should not allow non-combat moves to be done during combat move phase.
<br>* (PE) Only non-air units that did not move during combat move and did not participate in combat, may move during non-combat-move.
<br>* (PE) Transports can only be loaded in 1 phase (not both), and unloaded in 1 phase (not both).

<br>* (NA) Each phase of combat should have all units in that phase fire before any casualty selection occurs, whereas right now in TripleA if air and subs are involved then units might be broken up into smaller groups and casualty selection done for each group.
<br>* (EM) If you select for a bombardment from a sea zone, you should be able to select which units you want to have bombard, but currently all possible units are used.

<b>Political Situation</b><br>
At the start of the game Germany and Italy are at war with the UK and ANZAC and France only, while Japan is at war with China only. Any countries not at war with each other ignore each other's naval units and obviously cannot go into each others ground territories. There are a number of specific politically related rules/conditions for each country:<br><br>

<b>Germany/Italy/Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>Germany/Italy/Japan can declare war on USA or Russia or China at any time.</li>
<li>If Germany/Italy/Japan is at war with one of USA or Russia or China it doesn't affect relations with the other.</li>
<li>While not yet at war with the USA, Japan may not move into sea zones within 2 spaces of Western USA or Alaska.</li>
<li>If Japan attacks a Russian territory next to Mongolia, all Mongolian territories and units are transferred to Russia. This does not occur if Russia previously attacked Korea or any Japan-controlled territory bordering Mongolia.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>Russia cannot go to war against the Germans and Italians until the <b>beginning of purchase units phase</b> of Russia 4, unless of course they attack it first, or the Axis capture London.</li>
<li>Russia and Japan may declare war on each other at any time.  When not at war, Russia may not enter China.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>If USA is not at war with Germany or Italy, USA may only move its units to sea zones touching USA territories and also Sea Zone 102.</li>
<li>If USA is not at war with Japan, USA may not move its units into sea zones touching Japanese controlled territories.</li>
<li>USA cannot go to war against the Axis until the <b>beginning of PU collect phase</b> of USA 3, unless of course an Axis power attacks it first.</li>
<li>Once at war, the Minor Factories in continental USA upgrade to Major Factories automatically for free, and may be used immediately.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Neutrals</b><br>
There are three types of neutrals: 
<ul>
<li>pro-Axis: When an Axis unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>pro-Allies: When an Allied unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>Regular: If a power attacks a regular neutral, all the other regular neutrals on the board become friendly to the other team.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Capture of friendly neutrals must be done during Non Combat Movement.<br><br>

When a country moves into a regular or non-friendly neutral during the combat move, it must conduct combat with the number of infantry specified on the map for that neutral. If it loses or retreats, however many infantry that remain are how many that stay in the zone. This means that if Finland was +4 for Axis, and Russia kills 2 infantry and retreats, then Axis only get 2 infantry when they move into Finland.

</ul>
<br><hr><br>


<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Kamikaze Attacks</b><br>
Japan starts the game with 6 attack tokens, and may begin doing Kamikaze Attacks at the start of the game.<br>
These attacks can only be done in sea zones that contain the Kamikaze symbol [the sea zones surrounding: Japan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, and the Marianas].<br>
At the end of Japan's enemy's combat-move phase, Japan may target any surface warship in a Kamikaze zone for one or more Kamikaze attacks, ONLY if the enemy is attacking Japanese units there or is conducting an Amphibious Assault from that sea zone.<br>
For each attack, a die is rolled, and a 2 or less is considered a hit. Casualties are removed immediately, and do not participate in any battles. Kamikaze attacks prevent bombardment as well.<br>
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Submarines Prevent Unescorted Transports From Making Amphibious Assaults</b><br>
In any Sea Zone containing an enemy submarine, but not containing an owned warship, the submarine will prevent the offloading of troops for an amphibious assault. 
<br><br><hr><br>


<b>Scrambling</b><br>
Fighters and/or Tactical bombers can be scrambled from any territory bordering a sea zone, with an operating airfield (less than 3 damage) to help defend the surrounding sea zone using their standard defense values. They cannot retreat from scrambling (defenders can never retreat) and if the territory they were scrambled from is captured, they're given one extra movement point to land on a friendly territory or open carrier. Scrambled air cannot participate in any other battles that round.
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Strategic Bombing Runs (SBR)</b><br>
Bombing can now happen against both types of ICs, harbours, and airfields (attackers choice)[tactical bombers can not target factories though]. Fighters can participate in the bombing run as escorts. Fighters in the territory being bombed can be launched as interceptors (no airfield necessary).<br><br>
<b>If interceptors are launched:</b> a one-round air battle takes place right away all air involved roll at 1 (jets rolls at 2). Either attacking bombers or fighters can be taken as casualties.<br><br>
After the air battle, or if there were no interceptors, the escorts are retreated and any bombers/tacs remaining can now be divied up to attack specific targets. Each target rolls its built-in AA gun against the bombers/tacs targetting it. If there is an AA gun in the territory being bombed it does <b>not</b> roll because its there to defend combat units and not complexes/bases.
<br><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Blockade Zones</b><br>
If any enemy ships are in a power's blockade zones at the end of that power's turn, and the power controls the adjacent ground territory, then the power may lose some of the PUs it would have otherwise collected.<br>
Surface warships roll 1 dice, Submarines and Air units roll 2 dice, and carriers and transports roll zero dice.  For any roll of 3 or less, that amount of PUs will not be collected by the surrounding land territories.
The power in question cannot lose more PUs from a blockade zones then the worth of the adjacent ground territory to those zones.

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Placement Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 3 or more, and must be originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 2 or more.</li>
<li>Industrial Complexes can't be built on islands.</li>
<li>Over-purchase is returned and money is reimbursed.</li>
<li>Aircraft can be placed on the ground or on a [new] carrier in the adjacent sea zone that has a spot(s) open.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>

<b>Units</b><br>
These changes to units are things other than price/movement which you can see in the buy menu.
<ul>
<li>Bombers now do 2 additional damage in strategic bombing raids, in addition to their dice roll.</li>
<li>Carriers are two hit.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes have 3 production capacity. A Minor IC can be upgraded to a Major IC for 20 PUs, but only on originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes have 10 production capacity. When a Major IC is captured it automatically becomes a minor IC.</li>
<li>AA Guns may be taken casualty in combat, and may only fire at up to 3 aircraft each.</li>
</ul>

<b>New Units</b><br>
<b>Tactical Bombers:</b> can land on carriers, can bomb, and if paired with <b>a tank or fighter</b> the Tac attacks at 4. Tactical Bombers can also strategic bomb Airfields and Harbours (but not factories).<br>
<b>Mechanized Infantry:</b> can blitz when paired with a tank, and are supportable by artillery.<br>
<b>Carriers:</b> now have 2 hitpoints, and when damaged they do not allow fighters to land, or to leave if cargo.<br>
<br>
<b>New Buildings</b><br>
<b>Harbour:</b> Any ships that start their turn in a sea zone adjacent to a harbour get +1 movement points. Any damaged ships are repaired by a harbour at the start of the player's purchase and repair turn phase. Lastly, harbours can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the above bonuses.<br>
<b>Airfield:</b> Any air that start their turn on the ground territory with an airfield get +1 movement points. Airfields allow up to 3 planes on that island to scramble (see Scramble section above). Airfields can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the movement bonus.
